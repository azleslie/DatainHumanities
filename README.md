# DatainHumanities

This beginner grab-bag workshop is designed to help with some of the initial hurdles to working with data in the humanities: translating sources into usable data formats.

It can be used as a lead-in to the [Quantitative Text Analysis](https://github.com/azleslie/TextAnalysisIntro) and [Data 101](https://github.com/azleslie/Data101) workshops I've run.

This workshop was originally offered during the Fall 2019 semester at Rutgers University-New Brunswick through the [New Brunswick Libraries Graduate Specialists program](https://libguides.rutgers.edu/graduatespecialist/) and the [Rutgers DH Initiative](http://dh.rutgers.edu/).
