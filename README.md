# DatainHumanities

This beginner grab-bag workshop is designed to help with some of the initial hurdles to working with data in the humanities: translating sources into usable data formats.

It can be used as a lead-in to the [Quantitative Text Analysis](https://github.com/azleslie/TextAnalysisIntro) and [Data 101](https://github.com/azleslie/Data101) workshops I've run.

This workshop was originally offered during the Fall 2019 semester at Rutgers University-New Brunswick through the [New Brunswick Libraries Graduate Specialists program](https://libguides.rutgers.edu/graduatespecialist/) and the [Rutgers DH Initiative](http://dh.rutgers.edu/).

## File Guide
**DatainHumanities.Rmd** Master .Rmd file for user participation in the workshop, to run or edit code as desired; used to generate .pdf file.

**DatainHumanities.pdf** This .pdf file is best for viewing the workshop or following along outside of an R or RStudio environment; it contains all code as well as sample outputs and figures.

**/images** Individual files for the images used in the .pdf and master .Rmd files.

## Setup for Beginners
If you’re new to R, you’ll need to set up access in one of two ways first. The standard method is to [download R itself](https://cran.rstudio.com/) for whichever operating system you're using and then [download RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that makes working in R clearer by adding a text editor for writing or loading R code and a workspace for viewing data in memory.

If you want a fast, easy way to give R a try with a stable internet connection, you can use [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/). This browser version of RStudio looks and functions just like the desktop version, and it saves data between sessions too. All it takes is a Google account to log on. You can even clone this workshop repository directly into your RStudio Cloud workspace by clicking the arrow next to the “New Project” button, selecting “New Project from Git Repo,” and then pasting the url to this page.
